		<p>Dear Recruiter,</p>
        <p>I am writing to express my strong interest in the Backend Developer position at your company. With a proven track record in developing robust and scalable backend systems, I am confident in my ability to contribute effectively to your dynamic team.</p>
        <p>In my previous role as a Python Backend Developer, I have successfully designed, implemented, and maintained backend solutions using a variety of Python frameworks, including FAST API and Flask. I have also create GUI tools for desktop using Tkinter. My proficiency in these frameworks allows me to create efficient and high-performance APIs that meet both functional and business requirements.</p>
        <p>One of my strengths is my expertise in working with databases and data modelling. I am well-versed in SQL and have experience using the SQLAlchemy ORM to manage and query databases effectively. I am also familiar with NoSQL databases such as Redis and MongoDB.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, my familiarity with cloud services such as AWS and version control systems such as Git and Github, enhances my ability to deploy and manage code. I write clean, resuable and secure code and follow all industry best practices.</p>
        <p>Additionally, my proficiency in technologies such as Bash, Selenium, Playwright, Robotic Process Automation allows me to automate routine tasks, perform UI automation and web scraping, sometimes come handy and increase productivity.</p>
        <p>I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to bring my technical skills and passion for backend development to your team. I am confident that my experience and dedication make me an ideal candidate for this role.</p>

        <p>Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my skills and experiences align with the needs of your company.</p>
        <p>I have attached a copy of my latest resume along with this letter.</p>
